Implementing  logistic Regression and Support Vector  Machines techniques on Marketing dataset

In this study, I want to perform logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines techniques to predict subscriber behavior and determine whether
the customer accepts a new offer.

In this study, I cleaned the data and performed descriptive analysis to get a better understanding of the data, and then I examined the Logistic Regression 
and SVM machine learning models to predict subscriber behavior and determine whether the customer accepts a new offer. At first, I performed Feature Scaling 
to have a standard scale then performed the logistic Regression and SVM models. The accuracy of logistic Regression was 90.17% with a Precision rate of 69% 
and recall of 35%. And the accuracy of the SVM model was 89.12% with a Precision rate of 75% and recall of 46%. As a result, despite the better accuracy of 
the Logistic regression model, the SVM model had better precision and recall rate, therefore, it would give us a better prediction than Logistic regression. 
Finally, I performed a stepwise feature selection technique to find the most important variables that have a significant impact. the most significant variables were Recency', 
'MntFruits', 'MntMeatProducts', 'NumDealsPurchases', 'NumWebPurchases', 'NumStorePurchases', 
'NumWebVisitsMonth 'AcceptedCmp3', 'AcceptedCmp4', 'AcceptedCmp5', 'AcceptedCmp1', 
'AcceptedCmp2', 'Z_CostContact', 'Z_Revenue', 'Age', 'Education_Basic', 'Education_Graduation', 
'Education_PhD', 'Marital_Status_Single', 'Marital_Status_Together', 'subscription_duration'
